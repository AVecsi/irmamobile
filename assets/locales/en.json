        "question_1": "What can I do with Yivi?",
        "answer_1_markdown": "With Yivi it's easy to log in and make yourself known. You disclose only the necessary attributes of yourself. For instance, in order to watch a certain movie, you disclose that you are over 16 years old and nothing else. With Yivi you can digitally sign documents too. You only use relevant characteristics of yourself, in some sort of digital stamp. In this way Yivi allows you to sign as medical doctor, as citizen, or in some other role.\n\nMore and more websites support logging in with Yivi. For instance, doctors in The Netherlands can access medical dossiers via the website [helder](https://www.helder.health/). Yivi support is growing especially at municipalities and health care providers. To get an idea of the possibilities, you can try out yourself some of the available Yivi [demo's](https://privacybydesign.foundation/demo-en/).",
        "question_2": "Why does Yivi exist?",
        "answer_2": "**Yivi exists because you have the right to an online identity that you really own.** Yivi is not a commercial app that is used to track you, to profile you and to sell your personal data to third parties.\n\nYivi is in the spirit of the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/). Via the Yivi app you disclose only these data about yourself that are relevant and necessary in a particular situation.\n\n**With the Yivi app your identity is in your own hands, within the secured Yivi app on your own phone.** The Yivi app is is a powerful means for making yourself known (online) and for digital signing. With respect for your privacy.",
        "question_3": "Who is behind the Yivi app?",
        "answer_3_markdown": "Yivi is produced by the **Privacy by Design** foundation. In 2016 this foundation grew out of the Digital Security research group at Radboud University Nijmegen. This foundation is independent and non-profit.\n\nThe Yivi app is open source and is developed jointly with SIDN, the manager of the .nl-domain. This development is done jointly with local government and health care. Some 30 municipalities are involved, including Nijmegen, Amsterdam and Leiden. Yivi is recipient of the Dutch Privacy Awards 2018.",
        "question_4": "How to use Yivi for logging onto a mobile website?",
        "answer_4": {
            "step_1": "Open the website on your mobile and select logging in with Yivi.",
            "step_2": "The Yivi app starts automatically.\nEnter your PIN.",
            "step_3": "Agree (or disagree) to disclose your personal data.",
            "step_4": "After disclosing you are logged in.\nYou can now use the website."
        },
        "question_5": "How to use Yivi for logging onto a website on my computer?",
        "answer_5": {
            "step_1": "Open the website on your computer and select logging in with Yivi.",
            "step_2": "Open the Yivi app on your mobile and enter your PIN.",
            "step_3": "Start the QR code scanner in the Yivi app. Scan the QR code on the screen of your computer.",
            "step_4": "Agree (or not) to disclose your personal data.",
            "step_5": "After disclosing you are logged in.\nYou can now use the website."
        },
        "question_6": "What to do if I lose my mobile?",
        "answer_6_markdown": "If you lose your mobile, nobody can use your Yivi app, at least if you have chosen a non-trivial PIN.\n\nYou can protect yourself even more: upon installing Yivi you have been given the choice to enter an email address. If you have done so, you can block your Yivi app altogether via [MyYivi](https://privacybydesign.foundation/myirma/). The Yivi app on your old (lost) mobile is then completely unusable.\n\nIf you have not yet added an email address in [MyYivi](https://privacybydesign.foundation/myirma/) you can still do so now. This is recommended.\n\nOn your new mobile you can re-install the Yivi app and re-fill it with your data. Then you are good to go again.",
        "question_7": "Can I install Yivi on multiple mobile devices?",
        "answer_7": "Yes, on every mobile device (Android or iOS) you can open a separate Yivi account and fill it with cards with your personal data. It is actually wise to do so. If you lose one device, you can still log on with your other device.",
        "question_8": "Where are my Yivi data stored?",
        "answer_8": "Your data are stored in the Yivi app on your mobile and not in the cloud.\n\nYou explicitly agree (or not) to reveal your personal data from your Yivi app to a website.\nWhen you remove your data from the Yivi app, they are really gone from Yivi.",
        "question_9": "What makes Yivi privacy-friendly and secure?",
        "answer_9": "Your personal data are protected via your personal PIN. Your data are stored exclusively in the Yivi app and not in the cloud.\n\nThe data in your Yivi app are digitally signed by the source (issuer) where the data come from (such as the local authorities).\n\nIn this way a website or shop, where you make yourself known, can cryptographically verify that your data are genuine.\nThis exchange of personal data happens directly between your mobile and the website. No one else can see that you make yourself known there, not even the organisation behind Yivi.",
        "question_10": "Why do the data in the Yivi app have limited validity?",
        "answer_10": "Every card in Yivi shows its validity. The validity period depends on the kind of data on the card and how stable these data are. Your name and date of birth data are valid for five years, but your address data only one year. The source (issuer) of the data determines this validity period. The cards in your Yivi app may thus expire. The Yivi app then gives you a warning.\n\nYou can always, also without such a warning, refresh your cards by reloading them from the source. For instance, after your 18th birthday you can reload your data from your municipality so that you can prove that you are older than 18 now.",
        "question_11": "What makes Yivi privacy-friendly and secure?",
        "answer_11": "The Yivi app has been developed in such a way that you and only you can see and use your personal data. Your personal data are stored on your phone only.\n\nThe Yivi app design enables a website or shop to (cryptographically) verify that the data you disclosed are genuine.\n\nThe Yivi app discloses your data directly from your phone to the website. No-one else can see that you identify yourself there. Even the organisation behind Yivi cannot observe such disclosures. \n\nWhen using Yivi, you agree with the [privacy policy](https://privacybydesign.foundation/privacy-policy-en/).",
