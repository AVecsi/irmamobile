You can use it to log in to online services or to prove your identity. But always while sharing the minimum amount of personal data. Because Yivi empowers you to make that choice. What you store, what you share, and with whom. You're in control, always.\n\nYou don't have to remember account details and long passwords. Only your Yivi PIN code. And when sharing data you're only sharing the data that is needed, nothing more. Be it to order a package online or to make an appointment with your doctor. \n\nWant to order a ticket online? With Yivi, you can easily prove that you're older than 18. And not share more details. Protecting your privacy in the process. You can also digitally sign documents with Yivi, using your personal attributes as a signature. You can sign as a civilian, a doctor, or with another role. Check the current overview to see the list of organizations that are already using Yivi.",

How long your data remains valid depends on the type of data. Your name and birthdate are valid for 5 years. Your address just one year. You can always refresh your data, whenever you want.
